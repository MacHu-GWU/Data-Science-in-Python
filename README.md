Data-Science-in-Python

===============================================================================================================
Main idea:

Many statistician, mathmatician, data analyst, they thought they know programming very well. But actually, it is the programming blocked them from developing great product. They rarely thought about control the memory, accelerate their algorithm and make it extensibile, adaptive to application. Learning new tools is a tough thing for non-computer science background analyst. We should not only know SAS, R, MATLAB.

In order to help my statistician and mathmatician friends to quickly learn PYTHON, this learning material can:
• Develop an interactive python Machine Learning course material for statistician
• Bridge the gap between statistician and programmer by providing vast example and practice

Why PYTHON?

Algorithm
Scientific calculation
Machine Learning
Statitical tools
SQL Database
NOSQL
Hadoop
API access
Most powerful extension community covers all kinds of field even except programming and math.

All-in-one, cross-platform, light-weight, high-performance (with Numba, etc), extremely easy to learn development language
