=== NUMPY ===
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:
	1. a powerful N-dimensional array object
	2. sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
	3. tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
	4. useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.
